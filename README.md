# Description
This introduction serves as a presentation, corresponding to the project. In which it is approached, in general, the process of implementing a program, in the netbeans IDE, 
classes, creation of Objects, as well as the other methods, attributes and parameters that each Object has.
The work consisted of creating a program, in which, in this case, we chose to create a game, similar to table tennis.
The concept of this game and the following one, we have 3 components, a board, a ball and two Sliders (Platforms) that move over the board, from top to bottom, and the ball, in which its movement is conditioned by the Sliders and by the hair board boundaries.
